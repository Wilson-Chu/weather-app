# weather-app
A simple weather app that uses the OpenWeather API to accurately provide weather updates for specific locations. Easily toggle between metric (Celsius, KPH) and imperial (Fahrenheit, MPH) units. Used vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Main learnings: Promises, async/await, API implementation

Future improvements: better-looking UI with some graphics for weather conditions and temperatures, custom Kelvin-to-metric/imperial conversion functions to reduce number of API calls
